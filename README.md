Th study involves prediction of direction and periodic return involving entire data set as well as clusters created out of the main dataset.
There are 5 clusters created based direction of movement of stock market and volatility. Following are the name of the files created for various prediction.


01. Direction prediction - clust1_diectionPrediction.R, clust2_diectionPrediction.R, clust3_diectionPrediction.R, clust4_diectionPrediction.R, clust5_diectionPrediction.R, Direction Prediction - full data.R 


02. Peridoic return prediction - clust1_periodicReturn.R, clust2_periodicReturn.R, clust3_periodicReturn.R, clust4_periodicReturn.R, clust5_periodicReturn.R, Return Prediction - full data.R 

03. Cluster Creation - cluster creation.R
